  <body>
    <div style="padding: 10px;"><p>*Getting there: Many flight options are available, cheaper options
*possible with airlines like Air Asia. Flying domestic in Indonesia is
*also cheap with airlines like Lion Air (Bali-Lombok about
*20Euros). Ferries between islands also possible.</p>

<p>*Getting around: On the island of Lombok no public bus network
 exists. Uber or Grab also non-existent. Motorcycle rent is most
 common. Otherwise private taxi.</p>

<p>In Bali, shared mini-van
 transportation possible. Uber, Grab and other service providers are
 forbidden. No public transport available from airport. Motorcycle rent is most common.</p>

<p>*Money: Visa/MasterCard accepted in most major establishments (upon
 addition of about 2-3% card charges). ATMs do not charge a fee for
 withdrawing cash.</p>

<p>*Language: English widely spoken.</p>

<p>*See: In Lombok; Relatively less touristic beaches, suitable for swimming,
 surfing, stand up paddling, wake boarding. Mt.Rinjani and surroundings
 which include waterfalls, rice fields, jungle treks, monkey forest.
 In Bali; Temples and local culture. More touristic beaches (Tourist
 infrastructure is more developed). Mt.Agung, Kintamani suitable for treks.</p>

<p>*Tips: Taking the ferry from Kuta,Lombok to Ubud,Bali is cheaper
 (about 13Eur) compared to flying (20Eur for flight+taxi). Look for a private
 shuttle bus to the airport (costs less than private taxi). Ubud is
 very crowded, so people looking to escape the city crowd should
 consider booking an accommodation outside the city. Experience local
 culture by taking courses like cooking, herbal therapy and so
 on. Renting a motorcycle is the best way to get around. Before
 booking any sort of service, please make sure the prices are very
 clear before hand! Be prepared to be bombarded by sales pitch of
 bracelets and Sarong in Lombok (all the time ..mostly)!</p>

<p>We arrive in Lombok on a rainy day and the rains continue the next
day. So on our way to look at the coconut oil extraction process, our
guide shows us the local ‘banana leaf umbrella’. I cant vouch for the
effectiveness but it looks exotic.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4728.JPG" /></p>

<p>A note about booking extra activities: always agree on a price before
hand, this avoids unnecessary discussions later on.</p>

<p>The traditional process involves dehusking a mature coconut, removing
the shell, extracting the coconut milk and boiling the milk to
separate the oil. So its not the cold press method. One can
differentiate the cold press and heat extraction method by looking at
the colour of the oil. Cold press oil is clear oil and the heat
extraction oil has a brownish tinge to it. The smell is also stronger
with the oil prepared by heat extraction. One of the great by products
of the heat extraction method, is a crumbly substance at the end of
the process which is used to prepare a dish pronounced as
Olah-Olah. It is similar to Gado-Gado but is much more rich in fat.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4733.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4735.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4738.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4745.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4747.JPG" /></p>

<p>We stayed in a village near Tetebatu. The village is quite close to
Mt.Rinjani and one can trek up to the volcanic crater lake. Its a 2
day activity. But if you climb to the peak then an approach from the
north side is necessary. The surrounding areas around the village is
dotted with rice and farm land. This area is not altered by tourism
yet. Other activities include waterfall treks, jungle treks and other
nature activities.</p>

<p>The next destination was Kuta, Lombok (not to be mistaken with
Kuta,Bali). It is on the south coast of Lombok and is mainly about the
beautiful beaches around.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4753.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4755.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4794.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/IMAG2647.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/IMAG2686.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/IMAG2680.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/IMAG2692.jpg" /></p>

<p>The atmosphere is very laid back, even the cats and dogs seem to agree</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/IMAG2698.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/IMAG2725.jpg" /></p>

<p>Plenty of ‘activities’ to do. One can visit the many beaches in Lombok
(entry fee of 10000 IDR sometimes). Do some water sports like surfing,
stand up paddling, rent a motorcycle and just drive along the
coast. Or just grab a coconut or a pineapple and just lounge by the
beach or take a ride on one of the many swings on the beach. Talk to
the friendly locals  (even if they are selling Sarong and bracelets).</p>

<p>We next arrive in Ubud, Bali. We choose Ubud to avoid the over
touristic southern Bali. Ubud is also very touristic and one should
look to book an accommodation outside of the city, to get away from the
traffic. Ubud invites the guests into an atmosphere of culture,
spirituality and hospitality. We arrive at a time of a major Balinese
ceremony and the streets are adorned with bamboo sticks with offerings
at the end (called penjors). The locals visiting the temples are
dressed in traditional attire along with offerings. In our homestay
offerings are prepared daily to be presented at the temple present in
each and every home.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4870.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4872.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/IMAG2735.jpg" /></p>

<p>We have lunch at a place called Faire Warung, which is a not for
profit establishment. The profits from the restaurant go to provide
free healthcare to poor people in need.</p>

<p>For a post lunch stroll we  walk around Ubud palace, which also a performance place for
many cultural exhibitions like dances and  musical performances.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4803.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4806.JPG" /></p>

<p>We stumble upon the lotus pond temple. The small pond in front has an
abundance of blooming lotus which is a perfect escape from the traffic
choked streets which leads to it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4812.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4814.JPG" /></p>

<p>One more stumbling incident, taking a short detour and following a
sign that said something like ‘rice fields this way’. At the end of
the trail about 400m the landscape opens out to endless rice fields,
the contrast cant be bigger from traffic clogged streets to the serene
lush green rice fields. Here have a look!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4828.JPG" /></p>

<p>The abundance of water means that rice is harvested about 3 times in a
year. A blessing indeed! Each rice field has an offering place for the gods</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4844.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4832.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4834.JPG" /></p>

<p>Amongst the many local experiences one can have, cooking class is one
of them. We enroll for a half day vegetarian cooking class. As
preparation for the ingredients we visit the bustling local
market. There are a lot of fresh produce and a lot of activity, people
stocking for a tasty meal at home, perhaps?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4902.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4878.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4879.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4885.JPG" /></p>

<p>Dont miss the red hot chilies!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4890.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4891.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4894.JPG" /></p>

<p>Even in the midst of all bustle, the vendors carry everything on their
heads (for example tables and goods!)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4896.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4899.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4908.JPG" /></p>

<p>We then head to the cooking place, located in the midst of rice
fields.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4927.JPG" /></p>

<p>We are offered a welcome drink and then taught to make our own
offering basket from coconut leaves. The offering is prepared
daily. There are three leaf components representing the Hindu
trinity. The offering is a daily part of their lives.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4930.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4931.JPG" /></p>

<p>We then head to the cooking area. The basic ingredients are
introduced, they include different types ginger, nuts, onion, chili
among other spices.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4940.JPG" /></p>

<p>The basic sauce is pronounce boom-boom bali.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4945.JPG" /></p>

<p>We also prepare gado-gado sauce (peanuts)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4946.JPG" /></p>

<p>The basic sauce is used to coat precooked tofu and tempe cubes which
are grilled over charcoal. Yummy!!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4953.JPG" /></p>

<p>We then take turns preparing various dishes  which include the soups, grilled
tempe sticks, fried tempe, rice, gado-gado sauce, pancakes stuffed with coconut
shreddings and jaggery.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4972.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4973.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4974.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4975.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4976.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4979.JPG" /></p>

<p>That was indeed a feast!</p>

<p>So what comes after Eat? Pray, of course! Cant ignore Hollywood
wisdom. We make our own little pilgrimage to the temples around Ubud
on a motorcycle.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4987.JPG" /></p>

<p>We first visit the holy spring temple, with water gushing out from a
spring in the temple premises. The pilgrims take a purifying dip in
the pond before offering prayers. All visitors are required to wear a
Sarong before entering the temple. This is provided at the entrance
after a voluntary donation.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4988.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_4995.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5008.JPG" /></p>

<p>The inner temple courtyard is reserved only for people offering
prayers.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5011.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5012.JPG" /></p>

<p>The temple complex is very inviting and peaceful.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5020.JPG" /></p>

<p>We proceed along mountains roads to the Besakih temple. It is situated
at the foot of Mt.Agung. It is amongst the oldest temples in Bali. It
consists of complex of about 12 temples, each temple dedicated to
different gods of the Hindu trinity and representing the 12 odd main
clans of Bali. The whole temple complex is adorned with 4 main
colours: black, yellow, white and red for the Hindu trinity (Brahma
gets two colours, so it adds up) and for water, air and fire.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5052.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5026.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5027.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5030.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5043.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5044.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5045.JPG" /></p>

<p>The Besakih temple is the main temple for the Balinese Hindus, which
also means that it is crowded by pilgrims and tourists alike.</p>

<p>Like the rice field walk, the Campuhan ridge walk is a welcome break
from the city and the traffic. Its an excellent stretch for a stroll
early morning or in the evening. Surrounded by green vegetation, it is
easy to feel and follow the rhythm of the gentle breeze.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5068.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5069.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5071.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5073.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5075.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5076.JPG" /></p>

<p>On the last day we catch up Kechak fire and trance dance. Part of the
performance is about Hindu mythological story of Ramayana. Followed by
a trance dance. The narration of Ramayana is slightly different from
Indian Hindu mythological narration. The stories incorporate local
culture and mythological characters that pre-date Hinduism in
Bali. The performance stage are scattered through the town and is run
by the locals.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5084.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5085.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5093.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5097.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5108.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5117.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5126.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5134.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5144.JPG" /></p>

<p>Its followed by a fire trance dance. Some coconuts husks are placed in
the middle of the stage and set fire. Then comes a performer in a
horse costume and stamps out flame. He later proceeds to kick the
glowing embers into the audience. Leaving a trail of audience who gasp
in disbelief, craziness of a trance!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5163.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5165.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/indonesia/DSC_5166.JPG" /></p>

<p>With this we end the trip that has spanned over Europe and traversed
much of Asia. The many encounters with people of different culture
revealed more similarities among people of different countries than
differences. Observing the daily life of people from all walks of
life, all ages, all social situations only helps to broaden ones
horizons. This removes many barriers which limit us in many
senses. Truly a priceless journey and invaluable experiences.</p>

<p>Asia much? Hmm .. not enough.</p>

<p>Terimakasi and Selamat Tinggal Bali!</p>
