    <div style="padding: 10px;"><p>*Getting there: We flew in from Osaka through Hong Kong. For the more adventurous, taking the train from Hanoi or even riding a motorbike or bicycle from Hanoi are possibilities.</p>

<p>*Getting around: Public bus network exists. Uber and Grab seem to be the most used services with their corresponding apps, they even offer motorbike taxis which are generally half the price of a taxi.</p>

<p>*Money: Visa/MasterCard accepted in most major establishments. Most Vietnamese banks charge a fee for drawing cash from ATMs. Techcom bank was an exception to this rule</p>

<p>*Language: English widely spoken.</p>

<p>*See: Stroll around district 1, visit the colonial buildings which include the post office, party building. The local market with multitude of fresh produce.</p>

<p>*Tips: Avoid ATM withdraw fee by using Techcom bank ATMs. Use Uber/Grab for getting around. If you want to be a pedestrian avoid the streets during rush hour (a motorcycle will also follow you on a footpath).</p>

<p>Vietnamese visa on arrival procedure is straightforward. After paying the fee and presenting the invitation letter, filled application form and a passport photo; the visa is stamped and handed over. Getting from the airport we took the taxi at the arrivals hall, on second thought maybe hailing an Uber taxi might have been cheaper. The streets of Saigon are filled by motorcycles and the overwhelming impression is that you are besieged by them at all times and they can appear out of any direction… magic!</p>

<p>Our homestay called the Vietnamese Homestay is a very cozy place. It was a former cafe being run in the home where the owner actually grew up. It is decorated effortlessly and gives an impression of an oasis of calm even when the motorcycles are zooming by on in the street in front.</p>

<p>We also met a hypno cat with shining eyes, and one can get near it only when the eyes are closed</p>

<p>The culinary experience is something else. The tropics come alive on your taste buds here. There is an abundance of vegetarian food</p>

<p>Visit to the local market is a colorful and hungry experience. There are so many fresh produce and new fruits and food to try out.</p>

<p>‘Street Coffee’ is apparently a thing to do in Saigon on the weekends. People just drop by and have coffee by the roadside cafes during weekends.  The coffee is really strong served with condensed milk and has a method very unique to Vietnam for preparation.</p>

<p>District1 has most of the notable sightseeing spots in Saigon. So a short stroll after the coffee should check those boxes as well</p>
