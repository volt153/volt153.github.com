  <body>
    <div style="padding: 10px;"><p>*Getting there: Low cost flights with Air Asia. Border crossing over land also possible via road or train.</p>

<p>*Getting around: Abundant options of mini-van and private buses as well as government buses.</p>

<p>*Money: Visa/MasterCard accepted in most establishments (subject to minimum spending limit/ extra charges). All ATM charge a transaction fee between 200-220THB as of March 2017.</p>

<p>*Language: English widely spoken.</p>

<p>*See: National parks, local food markets and beaches (of course).</p>

<p>*Tips: Arms charge a flat transaction fee, so estimate your expenses and withdraw the necessary cash for the vacation in one go. If exchanging currency, compare among different operators exchange rates vary. Transportation is not on time ,so factor it in, if your estimated time of arrival is late in the night (street dog menace!). National parks accommodation and camping options were impressive (we tried Sri Phang nga). If landing in Phuket, take the airport bus into Phuket town (old bus stand) costs far less than the taxi. Scooters are an inexpensive way of getting around, daily rent cost somewhere around 200THB (license is normally not asked for).</p>

<p>We fly into Phuket airport, the visa on arrival process is straightforward and short. We take the airport bus to Phuket town (old bus stand). The staff is very helpful and make impromptu stops based on the address information you give them. We decide to avoid the big cities and head off to Khao lak. It is about 90 minutes bus ride from Phuket and costs about 200THB. There are buses leaving approximately every hour.</p>

<p>Khao lak is on the West coast of Thailand. It is mainly a tourism oriented town and has abundant choices for accommodation, food and recreation for all budget spectrum. We stayed at the Dkaya hostel run by two sisters and were really impressed with the cleanliness and hospitality. One can rent scooters for the day as low as 200THB and explore the surrounding areas such as waterfalls, beaches and local landmarks.</p>

<p>Oh the food! Here are some snapshots, cant talk too much about it (busy munching) ..</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thai/DSC_4489.JPG" /></p>

<p>Exploring the local market at Khao lak was a feast for the senses even in the pouring rain. Shopping for fresh vegetables and spices and being able to cook them is definitely a memorable experience.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thai/IMAG0932.jpg" /></p>

<p>Khao lak was hit by the tsunami in 2004 and there are still many remnants, like this police patrol boat which was swept inland for more than a km.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thai/DSC_4492.JPG" /></p>

<p>There are also many stories of survival and hardships which one gets to hear from the locals and some tourists. Such life altering experiences present a different perspective on life for the survivors, it is one of the many gifts of travel to hear and share those perspectives from locals and fellow travelers.</p>

<p>Thailand in general is a very pleasant country to travel in. The tourism infrastructure is top! Most of the people can speak English and are willing to help in whatever way they can even if the language skills are limited, the food is great, the scenery is varied .. it has something for everybody</p>

<p>Be vigilant, surprises can spring around the corner!</p>

<p>Our first national park on the list is Khao Sok national park. We take a mini-van to get there and the driver has a particular driving style which can be described as ‘CRAZYYY’. Yes you cannot book that/not book that in advance. So sit back and see what you will get next.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thai/DSC_4506.JPG" /></p>

<p>Khao Sok national park area is much less touristic than Khao lak but more touristic compared to national park standards elsewhere. There are plenty of accommodation and restaurant options. Plethora of guides offering half and full day treks, canoeing adventure, night trekking,jungle survival trekking. We were not able to visit the floating camps on the lakes in the national park. It is also an activity that has many favorable reviews.</p>

<p>It is also possible to go trekking through the forest in the dry season without a guide. The path is very well maintained with clear markings.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thai/DSC_4526.JPG" /></p>

<p>Some detours lead to hidden streams and clearings which are ideal to take a break and a swim maybe?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thai/DSC_4650.JPG" /></p>

<p>Amongst the many national parks in the area, Sri Phang Nga is one. This time we choose to stay inside national park premises in one of the bungalows. The facilities are basic but comfortable. The camping area is also a great alternative provided one brings a tent along.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/thai/DSC_4687.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/thai/DSC_4720.JPG" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/thai/DSC_4722.JPG" /></p>

<p>The national park has many waterfalls which are a short trek away. The waters are very clean and inviting, the national parks have been very well maintained by the authorities and the locals visiting them also do their part of keeping the place clean.</p>

<p>Next destination is on the east coast of Thailand in a city called Prachuap Khiri Khan, much less touristic than even Khao lak. It has a really nice beach inside of an air force station. Definitely, one of the hidden places. There are plenty of beach restaurants. So pick a cozy spot, order some food and drinks. You can then just sit back and relax there for hours with gentle ocean breeze and soothing wave sounds. Happiness can be found that easy in the simplest things.</p>

<p>Kob khun ka and definitely see you next time Thailand!</p>
