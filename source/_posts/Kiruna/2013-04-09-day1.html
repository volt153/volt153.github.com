Waking up early in the morning and quickly stuffing some readymade "breakfast" last gear check and a look at the thermometer which said -10C we set out to the train station to board the

train to Abisko Turiststation which was the only train in the station. the train stops at Abisko Ostrastation but if you need to get to Kungsleden and to the STF offices get off at Abisko Turiststation.

Getting off at Abisko we headed off to the reception at the STF office there to buy some extra copies of the map we would be using and getting more clarity on the kind of huts we would be encountering on the way and maybe try and pay in advance. However this was not possible and each hut had to be paid individually. Place at these huts cannot be reserved, however nobody is refused accommodation. Additionally grab a STF membership if you already dont have one it costs around 300SEK and you get a discount for a member for stays in the mountain huts, being on the trail for 5 days made sense to have one. The STF offices at Abisko are well equipped you can buy some last minute stuff you might have forgotten to plan for expedition meals, maps, compass, warm clothes, gas canisters. There is also possibility to rent equipment like cross country skis, pulkas, camping equipment. Its always better to book in advance though.
Around 9 am we set off on the well marked Kungsleden track. There is even a ceremonial entrance to it, the whole track is marked with red X and as long as one sensibly follows them one should be fine. it was a sunny day and the snow on the track was nice and compacted (as opposed to fresh powder snow) which made me feel even more comfortable and pushed me deeper into the daydream zone &hellip; ah this is going to be easy me said.

<p>
Easy it was &hellip; the track was well marked with red crosses which indicated the way we needed to take, there were some places where the track split or merged but it was fairly obvious with the map which route to take. After about 4 hours we almost reached our first mountain hut at Abiskojaure. The huts were visible and we had to cross a frozen lake to get to it, the perceived distance was very deceiving &hellip; we kept walking but it just didnt feel any closer. this was going to be a recurrent thing, with such a vast landscape and not too many points of reference, the finish line always looked so close but were not. Eventually we reached the hut and  the host was there to welcome us and point us to the beds in the dormitory, the cozy living place, the place to chop woods. Something has to be said about the wood chopping place, well equipped with a saw to slice it down to manageable pieces and proper large axes to split the dry wood in one go and a "smart splitter" to get the wood pieces into something that would actually go into the fireplace and burn neat piece of equipment that was. Those definitely were the boys toys of the day. Water could be collected from a hole drilled into the ground over the lake, this was communally used by all the residents of the hut. There was no flowing water and no electricity and no mobile coverage and no internet &hellip; but there were still about 38 people packed into the huts. Seemed like the normal day out for the Swedes. the first day wasnt as tiring, so it was time to brew up a sinfully good mix of hot chocolate, butter and a dash of Ardmore whisky (courtesy Tom) .. recipe courtesy Collin! this was to be the brew of the trip .. have to put down hot chocolate as a must for the next trip! and for dinner our masterchef Tom cooks up some chapaaathi and beans stew with generous (i mean generous!) portions of garam masala and butter, feast fit for a king of nowhere! if everyday was going to be so good it would indeed be easy. There was actually enough time on our hands to play some card games and generally just get bored. the stay at the hut cost about 305SEK with sauna! it is slightly less for STF members. dinner was properly hogged upon and after some relaxing time and some hopeful wait for northern lights it was time for some rest to take on the next day!
