The sun was out much earlier than the thought of even waking up, the blacking out curtains on the window wasnt sufficient to keep the sunrays out. So getting up and getting used to the

morning routine with the very basic. muscles felt all in order and ready to fire off for another day, the overly enthusiastic sledge huskies which dragged in some tourists in the neighboring hut were up and rearing to go. all good omens for an amazing day ahead, grabbed some breakfast and set off for the second day of walking, this  was going to be a longer day with 20km of trek and climb.

Along the way on the first incline we met a group of 10 odd nordic/cross-country skiers struggling up the incline, guess the only time where we felt happy we were not on skis .. fully aware that they are going to zip ahead on the slightest down gradient. We kept climbing and leaving behind the tree line, that should have been an indication of the kind of conditions that could be possible in a remote place like this.. somehow like the creaking door and the occasional bat in a haunted house warning you not to proceed any further. The sun was still out and based on the suggestion of some skiers at Abiskojaure it was decided at about 740m to take a detour from the marked path to follow a bit longer path which was supposed to help us save some of the unnecessary ups and downs on the marked trail, so we started to walk towards the lake marked as Ribakluokta on the map, there was supposed to be a snowmobile and dog sled track which was visible and which was our reference to follow. Nature does have a sense of humor, which we didnt appreciate then .. about the time we started to deviate from the marked path did it f@#$%<sup>&amp</sup>;g change!! the clouds rolled in with snow, strong winds adding to the chill, the only time when I felt the cold. The sun was almost masked out, being nothing more than a disc of pale light, as you kept walking you could see the snow flakes being whipped off the ground almost like grains of sand in a desert. WOW what a welcome into the arctic circle, could almost imagine polar conditions from this. Now we knew exactly what we had signed up for.. all the thoughts of ease, comfort and the smiles on the faces were wept right off with the winds. Add to that the stance and stride with the snowshoes is quite unnatural combined with insufficient physical conditioning punished me with some jabbing pain with every step, it was literally one step after the next, couldnt afford to think far ahead. These winds and temperature froze up the drinking water, I had a camelbak and had thought of the possibility that water would freeze and got a thermobak casing for the reservoir but foolishly overlooked the pipe that ran from the reservoir to the outside! Mein gott! enough with the screw ups! These conditions also meant that we were unable to locate the tracks of the snowmobile and the dog sledges in the fresh snow adding a couple of kms to our meandering path &hellip; [\stickyNote fill in thousand more words complaining of our plight]. No wonder we dont have so many pictures on the trail from day2.

Finally we were able to spot the STF mountain huts in the distance and conveniently calculated as just being a few steps away, even though we knew better from the previous day&hellip; you keep walking and it doesnt come anywhere nearer its like the huts are walking away from you. I had to break often just to stretch my muscles to be able to take the next couple of steps but still no relief from the pain, one of the locals on a snowmobile ferrying supplies offered me a ride to the STF mountain huts which had to be refused .. all or nothing rt? after a small chit chat it was time to hobble and wobble to the destination. As with some of the huts we were to encounter this one was situated on a hillock and the final climb to get there was the final straw! was a exhausting(not just throwing this word around) day all in all. Looking at the condition of the huts drove in the point further of where we were, the huts we stayed in was snowed in with about 4-5 ft of snow at parts around it which had to be shoveled out to make way to the entrance. The "hordes" of people had started to thin out, we three were the only people in this part of the mountain hut.There were other people in the neighboring huts. Hoping for the leg pain to disappear it was time to call it a night and head off to sleep.
