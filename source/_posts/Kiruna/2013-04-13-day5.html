By morning we had heard some stories of the oasis of comfort called Kebnekaise. At least this day wasnt going to be as long as the previous one, it was indeed a relaxed trek onwards. There 
<!-- more -->
was a initial climb to about 800m for the first 3km. From there on it was downwards in the valley.
</p>
<p>
walk through the valley showed up some spectacular frozen waterfalls, some of them were this deep blue .. a colour that I havent seen (except maybe on a led lamp with 4 million colours).
so yeah this was a day just to switch off and meander through the path.

<p>
y late midday we hit the point where we were able to see the vegetation and trees again and the snow was also beginning to thaw at these heights. Saw a couple of reindeers domesticated or otherwise. and a lot more skiers doing a short trip from Kebnekaise.

Like everytime &hellip; the final pitstop is atop another hillock, trudge on jackass! getting into the Kebnekaise reception area was nice, but strangely with all the comforts was not remotely as refreshing as some of the mountain huts on the way .. but the idea soon changed when we were able to relish a beer at the price for which you can almost get a mass of beer in the Oktoberfest. The dorm bunks were paid for and dinner ordered as well. Now it was the time to get some warm water bath! ahhh now your talking &hellip; followed by a small stroll. The restaurant had a nice dinner cooked up, but have to admit the portions was somehow small and hence a second go at the delicious walnut dark bread with generous dollops of butter .. utterly bu.. is that copyrighted? After dinner was the usual round of chill out, but this time it was on comfy couches , but we had better lighting on all the huts with the fireplace and candles. Kebnekaise is an almost an ideal trade off between middle of nowhere and get pampered resort, one can get here from Nikkaluokta via snowmobile taxis which ferry people on the 19km track, so no need to sweat it! but of course we cant take it, we had to finish the last stretch on foot and complete this as we imagined it.
