Happy feet!! was definitely the emotion .. since the end of the 'one for the record books' journey was coming to an end, no more 20km odd treks with 20kg gears .. after this day! 
<!-- more -->
Breakfast buffet was ready, the day start was relaxing. Decking up on some calories to burn, we set out on one last , the last stretch of our kungsleden trek. As expected there were herds of skiers and snowmobiles along the way .. definite indication that we were reaching the finish line. The snow was already being to thaw and we had to watch out for ice and thin ice .. was particularly bad  at one stretch with puddles created by regular snow mobile traffic and the approaching spring and had partially frozen over again forming thin layers of ice .. so a detour on a unmarked path over a water body was called for  .. through deep snow without snowshoes (they came off long time back .. in case you missed it) .. this gave way to some choicy selections of swear words from the travelers. If only I had a penny for every curse uttered. The rest of the trek was largely uneventful. It was smooth here on, nice compacted tracks, no more slopes, one could even hear some of the early birds shouting for summer and some worms, at the end of 19km Nikkaluokta finally showed up&hellip; nice! a jubilant session of hifive was called for &hellip; it was indeed the end of the line. Hanging up the stinky happy feet in the fresh air, thinking of all the days and sights, no freebies - each step had to be earned - even on the slopes, definitely deserved all the aches and pains for all the bad planning, of all the people we met along the way - the Norwegian guy who was on his way home from south of Norway all the way past Abisko on a lone wolf journey spanning over 90 days.. no matter how crazy you do it, there are crazier ways to do it, the friendly hosts along the way, the Swedish couple in kebnekaise who were visually torn between being mortified, impressed and laughing in my face after hearing the journey, of all the memorable quotes "snowshoes make you faster" &hellip; ahh good times, already missing the journey. having taken care of the stinky feet it was time to get in for  a celebratory beer and wait for our bus journey back to kiruna and of course scheme for the next adventure &hellip; stay tuned!
