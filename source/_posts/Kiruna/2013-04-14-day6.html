Happy feet!! was definitely the emotion .. since the end of the 'one for the record books' journey was coming to an end, no more 20km odd treks with 20kg gears .. after this day! 
<!-- more -->
Breakfast buffet was ready, the day start was relaxing. decking up on some calories to burn, we set out on one last , the last stretch of our kungsleden trek. as expected there were herds of skiers and snowmobiles along the way .. sure fire way that we were heading to the end. the snow 
was already being to thaw and we had to watch out for ice and thin ice .. was particularly bad  at one stretch with puddles created by constant snow mobile traffic and the approaching spring .. so a detour on a unmarked path over a water body was called for  .. through deep snow without snowshoes (they came off long time back .. in case you missed it) .. this gave way to some choicy selections of swear words from the travellers. the sacrificial lamb (meaning heaviest one was sent out first) followed by the others. the rest of the trek was largely uneventful. just ploughing through the rest of the route, nikkaluokta was finally reached&hellip; nice! a jubiliant session of hifis was called for &hellip; it was indeed the end of the line. hanging up the stinky feet in the fresh air, thinking of all these days and sights, each step earned for no freebies even on the slopes, definitely deserved all the aches and pains for all the bad planning, of all the people we met along the way - the crazier people like the norwegian guy who was on his way home from south of norway all the way past abisko on a lone wolf journey spanning over 90 days.. no matter how crazy you do it, there is crazier ways to do it, the friendly hosts along the way, the swedish couple in kebnekaise who were visually torn between being mortified, impressed or downright laughing in my face after hearing our journey (in case you are interested, they settled for being impressed..laughing in my face coming a close second), of all the memorable quotes like "snowshoes make you faster" &hellip; ahh good times, already missing the journey. having taken care of the stinky feet it was time to get in for  a celebratory beer and wait for our bus journey back to kiruna.
