<p>
Having the flight early in the morning was the only damper in an otherwise upbeat mood. Oh the naivety with which these legs set out .. oblivious to a future getting pounded and pulverized .. HA!
<!-- more -->
Still a bit sleepy and dreamy about the trip ahead. \enterFlashback The idea of trekking through 100 odd kms of Kungsleden, supposedly "the last remaining wilderness of Europe" was finalized in about 15 mins of skype chat (pat on the back - maybe not for the idea of doing it on snowshoes). The propaganda was on to recruit other crazies for the trip, the final team was: Tom - laid back crazy comrade known to rev it up only when needed like the fly past on the way to Khardung La(thats for another blog); Colin - the never say stop soldier .. was literally a machine (was about to find out soon enough); Martin - who unfortunately had to call it off due to illness; myself - oh please if I start to enlist my virtues you wont reach the end of the paragraph \exitFlashback

Boarding the flight at Munich, transited through Berlin and Stockholm where I met up with the Tom and Colin, finally reached Kiruna around midday. Getting off the plane with the only aircraft in the airport and feeling the warm sun and relatively warm temperatures solar powered the daydreams to unrealistic levels .. you know what I'm building upto right?
The transportation from the airport to Kiruna city is normally by airport bus which is timed with the flights. but you can also call an airport taxi which would cost about 300SEK. Kiruna is mainly a mining town with a big mine LKAB at the outskirts of the city or maybe the city is at the outskirts of the mine. The mine is pretty big and you cannot escape the view of it in Kiruna. Our host at the hostel "dont be scared if you hear a big explosion at 1 in the night! it happens sometimes if they are mining into new areas" .. hmm..wonder if we could ask for a wakeup call, thats waking up in style "I love the smell of TNT in the morning". It is also a popular tourist spot known for dogsledding, snowmobile tours, northern light tours and some combinations of the above. Its also famous for the icehotel which is completely made out of ice and is reconstructed every winter. The city has most of the things you need - supermarkets, restaurants, currency exchange and banks, very helpful tourist information center, pubs and even a night club with diner.

In Kiruna we were booked into Tommys house which a comfortable little hostel to get some good nights rest before heading off to Abisko the next day which was around 6am the next morning. that evening we got ourselves what we thought would the last civilized meal for a loooong time. Grabbed some cash - its good to have a fair amount of cash in case one plans overnight stays at the STF huts/stations, an overnight stay costs about 300SEK. Some last minute food shopping which led to some interesting shopping list, somehow somebody felt the need for garlic cheese as an essential survival tool or maybe it was meant to outsmell the smelly wild beasts or maybe to be used as a substitute for smelling salt. anyway it was at least destined to stink up the whole travel compartment the next day.
