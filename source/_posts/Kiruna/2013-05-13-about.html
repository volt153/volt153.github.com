Welcome! you seem to have reached my blog either by free will or at gun point. This is attempted to help anyone else who might want to do the same journey and partially also for us in case we want to retrace the steps again. Though I must say, please do your own research and dont rely soly on the information provided here. This year our journey took us to Kungsleden in northern Sweden.

The Kungsleden is a collection of hiking trails spanning over 400kms and our journey was over a smaller stretch of 105km. The accommodation and the facilities provided by STF along the way are the best you can find in the wilderness, you can also undertake this journey in the summer. So if this sounds interesting do read on! Of course if you have similar or better interesting adventures that you have done or plan to do, please do comment and share. We are on the lookout for the next adventure to finalize and undertake.
