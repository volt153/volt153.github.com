Waking up with the same pain on day3. Didnt feel so good of our prospects of finishing the trek 
<!-- more -->
as we had planned it. The original plan was to skip the stop at Tjäktja and trek straight to Sälka. The time pressure was also there since buffer days were not thought of .. yeah the planning was somewhat crappy. So it was decided to stop at Tjäktja for the night and decide on the next path once we reach there. With the pain in the legs had to really slow things down, well had to just go for the one step at a time thing again. The weather was good with the sun out, with a climb upto 1000m it was just a matter of walking it out. Once the STF hut was in view it was the same thing as day2, you see the destination and you walk and walk and walk and walk some more and still have more to go. yes this one was on a hillock as well.. bliss!

Arriving at the mountain hut, after the customary welcome was also the now customary question " why are you not doing it on skis?" lets leave it as a rhetorical question. We had seen NO one with snowshoes on the whole trip but only heard of mythical creatures having done it on snowshoes. So yeah if you havent already figures it out, dont do it on snowshoes .. get some skis .. it will be easy .. maybe too easy .. blue or red pill eh?

At this STF hut we were the only people staying, but the host was narrating a story when once 35 skiers landed up at this place among many other stories and anecdotes he had for us. So had the customary dinner of chapaaaathi, rice and beans curry.

Coming back to bad planning we had to do the next 25km at a stretch skipping Sälka and proceeding straight to Singi if we were to make it in time for our flight back on the 15th. With my leg pain, I had no option to veto this since I wouldnt get the speed going necessary to make it. So the plan was to take stop at Sälka and Singi and reach Kebnekaise on Sunday and take a snowmobile taxi to Nikkaluokta, thereby cutting the last leg of 19km on foot between Kebnekaise and Nikkaluokta.
