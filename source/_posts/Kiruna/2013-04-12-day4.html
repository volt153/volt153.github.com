However, a good nights sleep(since 4 nights) was able to at least reduce my leg pain helping me take relatively quicker steps.. so it was decided to make a push for Singi skipping Sälka. The

morning weather was sunny. There was a 3km uphill climb to upto 1100m after which was the promised land of downhill hallelujah!!

What a sight at the end of 3km! Imagine a valley stretching out for tens of kms with no roads no trees no vegetation just snow, can you imagine that from this picture? try harder .. just fills your vision .. this has to be what we have earned .. breathtaking.

The sun was in full force out and a peculiar day where I was sweating and still the water freezing. Trudging through seemingly endless stretches of snow walled in by mountains rising on both sides you almost feel like an ant walking through a palace.. well at least ants can carry 100 times their weight &hellip; carrying about 6000kg of supplies .. if that would have been possible we might have carried more creature comforts :P

Even before halfway through the route, the snowshoes had to come off, walking naturally was a relief and the pain eased a bit .. but I tended to sink in the snow a little bit and conscious effort had to be made to walk on the somewhat compacted track from the cross country skis and snowmobiles and dog sleds. However this was much more comfortable than walking on the snowshoes.

By midday we had covered about 13km and reached Sälka which was about halfway, with the sun still out and a quick bite we moved on to complete the final leg and reach Singi. By the end of 25 km the sweeping valley gave way to normal terrain, at least I had a serious case of are we there yet? you get your hopes up as soon as you see a corner hoping to see the STF huts and once that was dashed you immediately wonder .. "whats around the next one?" eventually we literally hobbled to the hut in Singi and got ourself a hut and after the now customary question .. "why the snowshoes?" .. and "its awesome on snowshoes, isnt it?" we got into our normal routine of brewing up , rolling up (chapathis I mean). It almost becoming second nature. The spirits were quite high that evening .. partly since we psychologically knew the 25km stretch was one  of the toughest stretch and we had done it! The other days are going to be easy now (I meant it this time). We had a group of 6 odd Swedish women sharing the hut with us and some of them seem to be really intrigued of how on earth did we end up in this part of Sweden and yes also the question about the snowshoes, hanging around the fireplace till about 11pm and just enjoying the peace after the long day we realized we were more than half way down, pat on the back! it was time to call it a night and for a relaxed non hurried trek the next day
